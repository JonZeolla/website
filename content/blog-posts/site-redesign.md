# Breaking News: A New Year, a New Look

Hello to and from the OSCAL Club Community. The community is small and determined, but even for the smallest of communities an easily editable website is key. So here we are! In order to allow members passionate about compliance and security, developer or not, to contribute to the site directly, I introduce the brand new site!

# What Changed?

The new website not only has some minor stylistic improvements, but big functionality enhancements.

- The use of [the US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), for a crisp look but also one that is accessible for as many users as possible.

- The adoption of [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/) and React platform, to allow for easily adaptable styling and interactivity that many web developers will find comfortable.

- Most importantly, the migration to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and [NetlifyCMS](https://netlifycms.org/) as a backend. This migration allows preview versions of the website before a pull request is reviewed, all while requiring passionate community adopters to contribute without a full developer environment on their computer.

So, get started today! You can simply click the [Help fix this site link](/admin) in the upper right-hand corner.

Oh, and expect more blog post series on the intersection of OSCAL and other topics soon. The new worflows will benefit all of us.

As we like to say in the OSCAL Club Community: 

> World unification equals world domaination, have a nice day!
